<h1>Installation Instructions</h1>

These instructions for installing Sxslt have been gathered from
experiences with Solaris and Linux, specifically Yellow Dog Linux.  In
all cases, we have had a very up-to-date collection of Gnome tools and
libxml (2.4.1) and libxslt (1.0.1) and higher.  We have not tried
porting this to Windows yet at all.  Your mileage may vary and we
would be very grateful to hear of any problems, patches for the
configuration process, etc. so that others can benefit from
the different experiences.


<dl>
  <dt>
  <li>
<i>Requirements</i><br>
      Install libxslt version 1.0.1 or higher
  <dd> This will require libxml2-2.4.*
<br>
     It is simplest if you do a full system installation of
      libxml2 and then configure and compile libxslt.
      You do not <i>need</i> to install libxslt, as this package
      needs access to the  libxslt source code anyway in order
      to compile some of the code.
      However, if you do not install it,
      you will have to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      environment variable to find the libxslt libraries.
      So, the simplest thing to do is install libxslt
      as well (and run /sbin/ldconfig or wherever it is on
      your machine).
      <p>

       For those users who do not have root permissions with which to
      install software in standard places on the system, the simplest
      thing to do is to compile and install libxml2 and libxslt into
      a sub-directory within one's own home directory. To do this,
      for example into the directory <code>$HOME/local</code>,
      specify the argument
<pre>
 --prefix='${HOME}/local'      
</pre>
      to the <code>configure</code> scripts for both libxml2 and
      libxslt.
      Then, run the commands
      <code>make</code> and <code>make install</code> in both,
      having added <code>$HOME/local/bin</code> to your path.
      (This is needed when installing libxslt so that it can find
       the <code>xml2-config</code> script needed to configure it.)
      

  <dt>
  <li> <i>Telling Sxslt where libxslt is</i><br>
      Set the environment variable <code>XSLT_HOME</code>
      to the fully-qualified name of the directory in which
      you un-tarred the libxslt distribution.
      Alternatively, you can specify this directory as a command
      line argument in the call to R CMD INSTALL as
<pre>
 --configure-args='--with-xslt=/the/directory'
</pre>       
      
  <dd> That directory should contain the subdirectories
      <code>libxslt</code>, <code>libexslt</code>
      and <code>libxslt/.libs</code> and
      <code>libexslt/.libs</code>.

  <dt>
  <li> Ensure that R is compiled as a shared library.
  <dd>
      
  <dt>
  <li> Install this R package in the usual manner
  <dd>
<pre>
  R CMD INSTALL -c Sxslt
</pre>      
</dl>

Note that in the future, we hope to be able to work from a fully
installed version of libxslt. However, not all the header files that
we need are installed during that process.  Specifically, we copy the
C source code that runs <i>xsltproc</i> and modify it to load the R
engine. That source file requires additional header files.  We hope to
find a more elegant way to handle this in the near future.
