<doc>

Example illustrating the results of passing a document(filename) or
document(.) to an R function.  Things behave as you would like with
the R function receiving an XPathNodeSet and the first element is an
XMLInternalDocument and we can use it in the usual ways.

<document file="sqrt.xml"/>

<pre>
doc = xsltApplyStyleSheet("document.xml", "document.xsl")
cat(saveXML(doc))
</pre>

</doc>
