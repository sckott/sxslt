When we load the XSL file and start the processing of the XML documentation
with XSL, the template for our top-level node defines the function

This has no title and you don't have to do much.
But then again, you don't get many marks either!
There are no solutions as the question seems vacuous and
the numPoints attribute doesn't appear.

Here we use an XInclude. If we instruct the XSL processor to follow
the XInclude directives, we will end up with a copy of the data in the
document.  If we don't, then the XSL rules for the resulting
xi:include nodes will provide a link to the data.  Can we do both?
This is slightly tricky because it is the XML parser that does the
XInclude. If we do it in the parsing stage, we don't see the
xi:include node, but just what it is replaced by.  So we need to tell
the XML parser not to do the XInclude, and then process that node so
as to a) put the link to the URL, b) process the XInclude.  The XML
package provides functions to do this.  Firstly, ensure that we
process the XML document with ,
e.g. 
<pre class="rcode">
xsltApplyStyleSheet("hw.xml", "hw.xsl", solutions = 0, xinclude = FALSE)
</pre>
Next, provide an XSL template for xi:include which
emits the link and then calls an R function
which processes the XInclude node.

There are two variables and if we look at a scatter plot, we see that
there is a linear relationship between them.
So a scatterplot with a regression line would be reasonable.

We can reuse the XSL code from IDynDocs to generate a plot and create 
the necessary output. 
This is in IDynDocs/XSL/html.xsl and dynRfo.xsl, etc.
There are minor issues about exporting those
functions as they use different names within closures, etc.
and so we need to sort that out first.
Alternatively, we can just define a simple function ourselves.
It will not be as general, e.g. dealing with 
references to other r:code nodes within the body of this r:plot,
but for our purposes it is quite simple.
We can define an XSL rule that calls an
R function defined as 
</p><pre xmlns="" class="rcode">
function(nodeset){
    node = nodeset[[1]]
    filename = tempfile()
    jpeg(filename)
    x = eval(parse(text = xmlValue(node)))
    dev.off()
    filename
}
</pre><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
This is called with the r:plot node as the argument which appears as a
XPathNodeset and so we fetch the first element which is the r:plot
node.  We create a graphics device using the <em class="func"><code>jpeg()</code></em> and
return that file name. Here we use a random file name.  Using the
<i xmlns:cpp="http://www.cplusplus.org" xmlns=""><a href="s:package(&quot;digest&quot;)">digest</a></i>, we can use a name that does not change unless
the code in the r:plot node changes.
</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
We can either call this function from XSL via r:call('funName')
or we can explicitly register the function via
addXSLTFunctions() and then use the name with which we registered it.
</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
There is one remaining problem to be solved and that is how do we get
the data for the r:plot code.  It is local to the question node, so we
need to ensure that it is defined.  We'll ignore issues of scope,
etc. and just load it into the global/session environment for now.  In
the r:plot node, we arrange to load the data from any r:data within
this question.  Since we are in the r:plot node within a question we
need to go back to the question node and then find all the r:data
nodes below it.  Here is where we use axes in XPath.  To find the
enclosing question ancestor node, we use ancestor::question.  Then we
can find all the r:data nodes below this as
ancestor::question//r:data.  We pass the set of these to an R function
that process each node and assigns the result of reading the data into
R to a variable identified by the r:var attribute on that r:data node.

</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
We can solve the issue with scope and overwriting global variables by
changing the way we deal with the data and passing it to the
<em class="func"><code>graphicsEval()</code></em> function.  The idea is that we will
restore the data to an R object within the
<em class="func"><code>graphicsEval()</code></em> and then we will evaluate the code using
the <em class="func"><code>with()</code></em> function.  We use much of the same XSL code
and the only difference is in the R code, as we should expect since this is really 
an R evaluation issue.
</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
If we don't use this approach, we need to put the plotting
code directly into the <em class="func"><code>with()</code></em> call ourselves:
</p><pre xmlns="" class="rcode">
with(d,
     { plot(x, y)
       abline(lm(y ~ x))
     })
</pre><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
Similarly, we need to have an r:var attribute on the r:data node.
