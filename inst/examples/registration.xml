This is a simple example of using an extension
function in the R XSLT module which is registered in R
rather than via the XSL code.
This example is intended to be run from within R,
in particular using the code in the associated
registration.R file.
That registers some R functions via the
<r:func>addXSLTFunctions</r:func> function.
These functions are registered with the R 
extension module in XSLT each time 
it is initialized and then become available to the
XSL rules.  
The registration.xsl accompanying this file
then calls one of those extension functions
when transforming the XML.

The <r:func>addXSLTFunctions</r:func> does not
register the functions with the extension module
directly. Rather, it maintains them in R and
waits for the module to be next initialized.
When this occurs, an R function is called
which performs the registration.
This means
